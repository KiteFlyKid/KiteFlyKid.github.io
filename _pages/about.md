<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Shang Ma, a third-year PhD student at the University of Notre Dame. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org/) and Prof. [Xusheng Xiao](https://xusheng-xiao.github.io/).

I completed my undergraduate degree at Sichuan University, Wuyuzhang Honors College, where I was a member of the college basketball team and the debate team. My undergraduate advisors were [Beibei Li](https://li-beibei.github.io/) and [Cheng Huang](https://chenghuang.org/).

My research interests lie in **software security**, with a focus on combining program analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to address security challenges.

In my free time, I enjoy road trips, going to the gym, and exploring history and military geography.
